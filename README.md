# bed2GwasCatalogBinomialMod1

This script is a modification of the /bed2GwasCatalogBinomial and calculates binomial p-value for genomics overlaps using the following criteria. The P-values were computed using binomial cumulative distribution function b(x;n,p) in R (dbinom function). We set the parameter n equal to the total number of GWAS SNPs in a particular GWAS phenotype. Parameter x was set to the number of GWAS SNPs for a given GWAS phenotype that overlap input regions and parameter p was set to the fraction of the uniquely mappable human hg19 genome (calculated with subscript) that is localized in the input regions and contains assessed GWAS phenotype SNPs. Calculated binomial p-value equals the probability of havingÂ x or more of the n test genomic regions in the open chromatin domain given that the probability of that occurring for a single GWAS genomic location is p. Note the p-values may be inflated depending on your input files. 

This script will connect to GWAS Catalog and download the entire data set, create bed file, and parse and uniq according to the N-1 input arguments. Last argument provided to the bash script should be a bed file that will be used to intersect parsed bed files from the GWAS Catalog. Number of overlaps is reported and initial number of entries in parsed files.  Finally, it will create an R script that will be executed to calculate binomial p-values for each overlap. Intermediary files will be removed, except: GwasCatalog.bed (entire catalog in a bed file), \*gwascatalog.bed (parsed original files from GWAS Catalog), \*gwascatalog.bed.cut.sort.uniq.chrXY (parsed and uniqed files from GWAS Catalog), \*gwascatalog.bed.cut.sort.uniq.overlap (overlap with parsed files, GWAS SNP positions), \*gwascatalog.bed.cut.sort.uniq.overlap.input.int.cut (overlap with parsed files, input regions), GwasCatalog2Bed.sh (sciprt to download GWAS Catalog and convert to bed). Note that names of phenotypes in GWAS Catalog start with capital letter but then next word is with small letter. **That is why we enabled case insensitive search in this script.**
